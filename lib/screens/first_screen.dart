This makes communication between isolates a little more complicated than between threads, but Dart provides a number of ways to pass messages between isolates. Isolates communicate by sending and receiving messages over ports. Each isolate has its own main loop, and when you send a message to an isolate, the message is put in a queue and processed when the isolate gets to it.",
